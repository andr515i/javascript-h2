<body>
    <!-- Buttons for each instrument -->
    <button onclick="playInstrument(0, './Harp.mp3')">Play Harp</button>
    <button onclick="playInstrument(1, './Guitar.mp3')">Play Guitar</button>
    <button onclick="playInstrument(2, './Flute.mp3')">Play Flute</button>
    <button onclick="playInstrument(3, './Saxophone.mp3')">Play Saxophone</button>

    <p>in the code, i have changed a few things which i think makes more sense, as well as added a few things. this is
        something like, calling the playInstrument method on each button, which then calls the original play method
        after that. with the way i had already set up my js, it just made more sense to continue out of that approach.
